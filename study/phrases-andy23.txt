the quick brown fox jumped
vote according to your conscience
tickets are very expensive
the bus was very crowded
the dog buried the bone
spill coffee on the carpet
this system of taxation
just in time for the party
it should be sunny tomorrow
be persistent to win a strike
the proprietor was unavailable
he is shouting loudly
work hard to reach the summit
toss the ball around
chemical spill took forever
I agree with you
fish are jumping
we park in driveways
the water was monitored daily
a lot of chlorine in the water
