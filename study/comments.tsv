rainy28	prediction works surprisingly well
jesse24	it's like a game
anthony30	hard to find predictions in page 2 and 3
luis23	i wanna use siri to type and i'm confused about the direction of the clock using LEFT and RIGHT buttons
jessica24	i made lots of mistakes by accidentally selecting the wrong characters
kuan-ting23	accidentally pressed RETURN, should have more more special position, not default position; having prediction makes a big difference
kevin23	verbs ending with `s` are often missing from prediction, e.g. `goes`
ben27	my fingers are really tired now after writing 20 sentences
afra29	the pointer is moving too quickly, confused about L/R when actually rotating clock-wise/counter-clock-wise
cindy29	it should learn words and suggest words that were previously typed, pointer speed should increase over time, not immediately go to full speed
josh20	prediction helps speed it up typing quite a bit, but correcting mistakes is a bit difficult
sander24	strange at first, but get comfortable with it quite fast. But you need a lot of attention, otherwise you make mistakes easily. Correcting a mistake takes the most time. When you focus on the word prediction you're not even that slow.
wolf32	it's a little bit like a game, selecting words is not as boring as selecting character by character
